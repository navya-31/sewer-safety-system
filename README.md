# Sewer Safety System

This project is a safety system I developed to detect harmful gases in sewer pits and alert sanitation workers using voice messages.

## Features
- Gas detection using sensors.
- Voice alert system using DFPlayer Mini.
- LCD display to show gas levels.
- IR sensor to detect worker presence.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino
- Gas Sensor (Analog)
- DFPlayer Mini (for voice alerts)
- LCD Display
- IR Sensor

## Files
- `sewer_safety_system.ino` → Arduino code for the system.
- `Sewer_Safety_System_Document.docx` → Project documentation.

## How to Run
- Connect the gas sensor, DFPlayer Mini, LCD, and IR sensor to the Arduino as per the circuit.
- Upload the `.ino` file to the Arduino.
- Power the system and observe gas levels on LCD.
- Voice alerts will play based on gas level and IR sensor detection.
